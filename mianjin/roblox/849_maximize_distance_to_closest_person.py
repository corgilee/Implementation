'''
Strategy: Linear Scan

Weâ€™ll scan through the seats array and calculate distances in three key cases:
Leading zeros (e.g., [0, 0, 1, ...]): distance is the number of leading 0s.
Middle zeros between two 1s (e.g., [1, 0, 0, 1]): distance is floor(gap / 2).
Trailing zeros (e.g., [..., 1, 0, 0]): distance is the number of trailing 0s.

Track the maximum of all such distances

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
